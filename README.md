Hi!

This is my cover website that I have put together quickly for Job applications.
I may go onto add more pages for my own blog as I am not a fan of social media algorithms.

To run this locally, open the directory with manage.py inside:
``python3 makemigrations``
``python3 migrate``
``python3 runserver``
